# euler-practice
This repository contains all the practice problems from [euler.com](https://projecteuler.net/archives) that I have finished and the next one I am working on. 

Each file will contain the following:
- Question / Problem
- Answer to the question
- Short Description on what I learned
- The code I developed to find the answer
- An AI's solution to compare and learn from after finishing
